## Projects
### Vietnamese Reviews Sentiment Analysis with Neural Network
[Detail](https://github.com/minhnhat2001vt/Vietnamese-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NN)

Build a Neural Network model that can classify vietnamese reviews as Postive or Negative.

### Multi-Label Topic Classification of Tweet
[Detail](https://github.com/minhnhat2001vt/Multi-Label-Topic-Classification-of-Tweet)

The goal of this project is to build a NLP model that can label tweets under certain topics. Using Tweepy, Tweets from 23 different topics are scrapped from Twitter. Then these Tweets are prepocessed and used to train 2 Supervised Learning Models (NaiveBayes and LogisticRegression)to perform multi-label topic classification task. The Performance of the models is then evauluated using three metrics: recall, precision and F1 score.

### Vietnamese News Classification
[Detail](https://github.com/minhnhat2001vt/Multi-Label-Topic-Classification-of-Tweet)

The goal of this project is to implement different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to classify online Vietnamese news by different topics. The dataset for this includes 41,276 electronic articles scraped from online newspapers, including: VnExpress, Thanh Nien Newspaper, Nhan Dan Newspaper, Tien Phong Electronic Newspaper, ... These articles are then pre-processed and used for training and testing. Achieved 90.0% accuracy with Machine Learning model (SVM).

This project focuses on detecting traffic signs in images and classify them as ’stop’, ’speedlimit’ or ’crosswalk’. The dataset for this project contains 877 images, each image contains a bounding box that specifies the type of traffic sign that appears in that image. The images are then preprocessed and used to train an SVM model for classification.The model achieved 0.978 Accuracy Score on validation (Test) set.

The goal of this project is to perform depth reconstruction using stereo images. This involves processing stereo image pairs (left and right images), calculating disparities between these images, and converting these disparities into depth information. This is done by implementing and comparing two methods in stereo matching: pixel-wise matching and window-based matching.
